Hey, it's us! üëã

We are **archiggrad.io**, an open-source company specialized in informing architecture, the right way.

## Why Choose Us?

- **Real Data:** We use REAL data, not abstracted or simulated data. This means we can detect problems in real time with a very high resolution.
- **In-house Trained AI Model:** Our AI model is developed in-house on dozens of test models.
- **Autonomous:** Our devices work fully autonomously; no supervision is needed.

## What Do We Do?
we can perform realtime temperature, sound, humidity, airflow, human circulation, gas and wifi heatmaps.
we can detect is your building is nor performing optimally
we visualize this data in a way that is understandable and intuitive for everyone. 

ww can find critical areas, such as hidden cold bridges and thermal leaks, sound insulation problems, air quality insificiency, indoor pollutanmts, 


we provide a analysis, and a sollution


Is your building not performing optimally? We can find the critical areas.
Real-time, high-resolution analysis of your building, indoor or outdoor. Once we have established the source of the problem, we can propose an optimal solution.
