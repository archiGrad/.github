## What Do We Do?

We specialize in **real-time spatial analysis** of hidden data, encompassing human circulation, temperature, sound, humidity, airflow, gas, and WiFi. Our mission is to **identify, analyze and propose a solution to underperforming areas in your infrastructure** such as hidden cold bridges, thermal leaks, circulation issues, sound insulation problems, air quality insufficiency, and indoor pollutants. 

<!-- We outperform traditional methods, offering both an economical and environmental advantage. -->
<!-- [Link Text](http://example.com) -->

## Why Choose Us?

- **Real Data:** We use REAL data, ensuring real-time problem detection with high resolution, frequency, and accuracy.
  
- **Autonomous:** Our devices operate fully autonomously; no supervision is needed.

- **end-to-end:** we are able to identify AND propose a solution.

- **flexible:** our service can be used in multiple fases, from design, construction, aftercare and restoration.

- **Communication:** we provide analytical and highly-communicative drawings, videos, models and applications.

- **Predicability:** With our end-to-end ML model, we can accuratly predict temperature,gas and sound propagatiopn, aswell as  human circulation
 <!-- high-communicative drawings, videos, and models to effectively communicate our proposals and analyses. -->

## How We Do This?

We leverage specialised soft-and-hardware developed in-house. 

## Research And Education

We are active educators and conduct workshops and lectures, including currently at Chulalongkorn University (Bangkok, Thailand) and Bartlett UCL (London, UK).
