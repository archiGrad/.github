# ArchiGrad.io

Hey, it's us! üëã

We are **archiggrad.io**, an open-source company specialized in intelligently informing architecture.



## What Do We Do?
we perform realtime spatial anaylysis of hidden data. This icludes: human circulation,temperature, sound, humidity, airflow, gas and wifi.
we can detect if your building is not performing optimally and we can propose an intelligent solution.
we communicate this data in a format that is understandable and intuitive for everyone. 

ww can find critical underperforming areas in your building, such as hidden cold bridges and thermal leaks, sound insulation problems, air quality insificiency, indoor pollutanmts, circulation problems 

we can outperform traditional methods which gives us an economical and environmental advantage.


Is your building not performing optimally? We can find the critical areas.
Real-time, high-resolution analysis of your building, indoor or outdoor. Once we have established the source of the problem, we can propose an optimal solution.


## Why Choose Us?

- **Real Data:** We use REAL data, not abstracted or simulated data. This means we can detect problems in real time with a very high resolution and accuracy.

- **Autonomous:** Our devices work fully autonomously; no supervision is needed.



##  how we do this?

inhouse designed spatial analisys software 
- **end-to-endmachine learning mopdel:** our In-house ml model is trained on dozens of test cases and helps us in finding critical regions.

## Who Are We?

### Deniz G√ºvendi
- **Role:** Architect üìêüë∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
- **Education:** Studied architecture in Istanbul, Krakow, and Ghent.
- **Degree:** MSc.Architecture specializing in sustainable development from KU Leuven.
- **Focus:** Adaptability, circularity, and nature-human-machine cooperation.

## What Do We Do?

We perform real-time spatial analysis of hidden data, including human circulation, temperature, sound, humidity, airflow, gas, and WiFi. Our goal is to identify underperforming areas in your building, such as hidden cold bridges, thermal leaks, sound insulation problems, air quality insufficiency, indoor pollutants, and circulation issues. We outperform traditional methods, providing both an economical and environmental advantage.

Is your building not performing optimally? We can find the critical areas through real-time, high-resolution analysis, indoors or outdoors. Once we identify the source of the problem, we propose optimal solutions.

## Why Choose Us?

- **Real Data:** We use REAL data, not abstracted or simulated data. This ensures real-time problem detection with high resolution, frequency and accuracy.

- **Autonomous:** Our devices work fully autonomously; no supervision is needed.

## How We Do This?

We use in-house designed spatial analysis software and an end-to-end machine learning model. Our in-house ML model is trained on dozens of test cases, enabling us to find critical regions effectively.
